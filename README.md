    once. If you reload the extension, please also refresh any webpages 
    already open you want to highlight from.
  
  - The extension may take more time if the webpage is very large. 
    Consider a time of 3-4 seconds to finish highlighting for lengthy pages.

  - The extension does not scan hyperlinks to maintain the posture of the 
    webpage.

    exclusively in that list . Many high frequency words are 
    shared between lists.

  - The extension might not work in certain Google pages like the Home 
    page. Please refer Chrome's policy on that.
